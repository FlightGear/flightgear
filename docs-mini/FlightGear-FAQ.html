    <u>Why won't FlightGear compile?</u></a></b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Well, that depends.  First make sure you are using the appropriate
          versions of FlightGear, SimGear, and plib.  If any of the packages are
          out of sync with the others, compilation may fail.</p>
          <p>The FlightGear <i>Downloads</i> page
          (<a href="http://flightgear.org/Downloads/">http://flightgear.org/Downloads/</a>)
          should tell you what versions you need if you are trying to compile
          the latest stable release.  If you are using a development snapshot,
          make sure all three packages are up-to-date.</p>
          <p>Also ensure that you have some implementation of OpenGL with glut
          support with the appropriate header files.  Linux users with nVidia
          cards should make sure you have the latest drivers from nVidia.  Other
          Linux users make sure you have Mesa3D
          (<a href="http://mesa3d.org">http://mesa3d.org</a>)
          and your X server installed correctly.  Windows users see
          <a href="http://www.x-plane.com/SYSREQ/v5ibm.htm">http://www.x-plane.com/SYSREQ/v5ibm.html</a>,

    <u>Why is FlightGear so slow?</u></a></b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>FlightGear supports hardware acceleration, but it seems not to be
          activated.  Make sure you have OpenGL libraries installed and
          configured properly and make sure you have the latest drivers for your
          video card.</p>
          <p><b>Linux users</b>:  If you are an nVidia user, follow their
          directions on getting your card working.  For most other users, make
          sure Mesa is installed property and ensure that you have the
          appropriate kernel device drivers for your card.  Most people (and
          distributions) use modules for their video card device drivers; run
          <i>`lsmod`</i> as root to see what modules are loaded.  You should also
          make sure that you are loading the appropriate modules in your
          XF86Config and that your video device section is correct.  Now try
          running an OpenGL application (other than FlightGear) to see how it
          performs.  You can try the <i>gears</i> demo from Mesa or something
          like <i>Quake3</i>.</p>
        </div>
      
        <b><a name="5.2">5.2 -
    <u>Why is my SGI machine so slow?</u></a></b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>First of all, one of the most common mistakes on SGI hardware is to
          forget to specify --fog-fastest. On most SGI machines the EXP2 shading
          model isn't hardware supported resulting in frame rates below 1 frame
          per second (fps).</p>
          <p>FlightGear makes extensive use of the OpenGL z-buffer feature,which
          on most older SGI hardware is only supported in software. This means
          that the CPU has to do all the z-buffer calculations in addition to the
          other tasks FlightGear involves (flight dynamics, scenery tracking,
          pushing commands into the graphics queue, etc).  The following features
          are software rendered on low-end SGI machines (like Indy and
          Indigo):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>stencil and accumulation buffer</li>
            <li>depth queuing and depth buffering</li>
            <li>fogging, lighting, clipping and transforms</li>
            <li>texturing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means that running FlightGear with the following options may not
          even get the desired result:</p>
          <p><code>./runfgfs --fog-disable --shading-flat --disable-skyblend \</code><br>
          <code>--disable-textures --disable-clouds --disable-sound \</code><br>
          <code>--disable-panel --enable-hud --disable-anti-alias-hud</code></p>
          <p>I could even imagine that adding --enable-wireframe doesn't work on
          these machines (I would be happy to be proven wrong though).</p>
          <p>On a machine like O2 the following options give an acceptable
          result:</p>
          <code>./runfgfs --fog-fastest --disable-sound</code>
          <p>Since I don't have access to other SGI hardware I can't tell which
          options would be appropriate for your situation.</p>
        </div>
      
        <b><a name="5.3">5.3 -
    <u>Stuck upside down after "crash"?</u></a></b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>In his infinite wisdom the FlightGear Grand Master decided that
          planes were to valuable to allow them to be destroyed by novice pilots
          who seemed to crash a lot.  The fact that nobody has bothered to model
          crashes may have something to do with it too.  :-)</p>
          <p>The result of this as you have noticed is that with a little
          practice an ingenuity you can trim the ship to fly inverted along the
          ground.</p>
          <p>The quick answer is to hit Ctrl+U (with the default key bindings)
          to warp the plane up 1000ft.</p>
          <p>For the stubborn people out there:  The trick to learn is to roll
          back to normal (non inverted) do this by nursing the elevator to get
          to about 500 feet or so and use the ailerons to snap roll 180*.
          This is all good avionics except for the plane not destroying
          itself.  Remember the controls work in reverse when you are inverted
          and keep that airspeed up!!!</p>

          <p>If you are using a development version of FlightGear, make
          sure you also have the latest base package.  See

        <b><a name="5.5">5.5 -
    <u>Why doesn't audio work properly under Irix?</u></a></b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>FlightGear (as of June 2001) uses the Portable Libraries (PLIB)
          for playing audio. The audio queue implementation of PLIB is far from
          optimal (in fact it's just wrong).  This seems to work on other
          platforms quite well, but Irix expects things to be programmed
          properly.</p>
          <p>There has been discussion about using OpenAL
          (<a href="http://www.openal.org">http://www.openal.org</a>)
          for the next release of both PLIB and FlightGear.  Tests show that
          the OpenAL audio implementation does the job right, meaning that
          these audio problems should be gone by then. In the mean time it is
          best to disable audio on Irix completely (by adding --disable-sound
          either on the command line or to your <code>$HOME/.fgfsrc</code>
          file).</p>

          calculate this yourself, start FlightGear at your location and take
          note of the altitude.  Here's an example command:</p>
          <p><code>fgfs --lat=45.50 --lon=-75.73 2>&amp;1 | tee fgfs.log</code></p>
          <p>The altitude is probably in feet, so divide the starting altitude
          by 3.28.</p>
          <p>Search the output log file for the first occurrence of the string
          "Loading tile" and take note of the filename.  In the above example,
          the output line looks like:</p>
          <p><code>Loading tile /usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601</code></p>
          <p>Copy a 3D model in a format that Plib understands to the same
          directory as the tile file.  Edit the text file in that directory
          consisting of the tile name with the extension ".ind".  The file will
          already exist if there is an airport on the tile; otherwise, you can
          create it from scratch.  In our example, the filename is:</p>
          <p><code>/usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601.ind</code></p>
          <p>At the end of the file, add a new entry for your object,
          consisting of the word "OBJECT_STATIC" followed by the model name,
          the longitude in degrees, the latitude in degrees, the altitude in
          meters, and the heading in degrees.  In our example the line looks
          like:</p>
          <p><code>OBJECT_STATIC Towerax.ac -75.73 45.40 60 0</code></p>
          <p>Save the changes to the .ind file, restart FlightGear, and
          enjoy.</p>
