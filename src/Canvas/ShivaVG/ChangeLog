    equal.

  * openvg.h: changed typedef of VGHandle to void*. Code
    compiles with no warnings on 64-bit systems now and
    it's much safer anyway.

  * shGeometry.c: shStrokePath() fixed to handle zero-length line
    segments gracefully

  * fixed the image color component ordering to be valid against the
    spec

  * Moved release-related info from ChangeLog to NEWS. ChangeLog will
    now include info regarding each commit to repository

  * Rearranged the path tesselletaion and user-to-surface transformation
    steps in the pipeline to produce higher curve resolution when path is
    scaled up

  * Using new pipeline design, transformed bound-box query can now return
    really tight bounds

  * Inserted empty/nop definitions for all non-implemented function so
    that linking against the library doesn't fail.
